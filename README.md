# 📝 Text Generation with GPT-2

Train a model to generate **coherent and contextually relevant text** from any given prompt.  
Using **GPT-2**, a powerful transformer-based model developed by OpenAI, this project demonstrates how to **fine-tune the model on a custom dataset** so it can mimic the style, tone, and structure of your training data.  
The implementation is fully interactive in **Google Colab**, allowing you to experiment with different prompts, adjust generation parameters, and instantly view outputs — making it ideal for creative writing, storytelling, and NLP experimentation.

# 🎯 Objective
Develop and fine-tune a GPT-2 text generation system capable of producing coherent, contextually relevant, and creative text outputs.  
This project provides an interactive interface in Google Colab for experimenting with prompts, parameters, and styles, enabling hands-on exploration of NLP concepts.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (PyTorch backend) for model loading, tokenization, and generation  
- **Google Colab** for a cloud-based, GPU-enabled execution environment  
- **Google Drive** for storing datasets and generated outputs  
- **Custom text dataset** for model fine-tuning and testing  
- **ipywidgets** for interactive prompt, style, and parameter controls

# 💡 Key Highlights
- Loaded the **GPT-2 tokenizer** and pre-trained model from Hugging Face  
- Implemented **interactive UI controls** to modify prompt, max length, temperature, and top-p dynamically  
- Integrated **sample prompt insertion** and **downloadable .txt file output** for easy saving of generated text  
- Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on a **custom dataset** for improved contextual relevance  
- Built a **text generation pipeline** producing meaningful completions for creative writing, storytelling, and exploratory NLP tasks  
- Understood the internals of **language modeling, tokenization, sampling methods**, and **transfer learning** in NLP
